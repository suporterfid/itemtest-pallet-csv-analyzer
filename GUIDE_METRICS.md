### üöö Logistics KPIs

| KPI | Definition | Formula / Calculation | Scope | Executive Purpose |
| --- | ---------- | --------------------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| **LogisticsReadRate331A** | Share of pallet/tote EPCs that begin with header `331A` and were captured at least once. | `count_unique(EPC where EPC.str.startswith("331A")) / total_expected_331A` using the filtered per-EPC summary returned by `metrics.summarize_by_epc` together with the manifest passed into `compile_structured_kpis`. | Structured mode pallets using serialized totes. | Validates that serialized logistics assets are detected when crossing the dock door. |
| **AttemptSuccessRate** | Portion of scan attempts that produced ‚â•1 valid EPC read. Attempts are defined by tote arrival batches. | `successful_attempts / total_attempts`, where each attempt groups reads by tote identifier (`LayoutID` or manifest column) and arrival timestamp bucket derived from the manifest CSV; compute counts inside a logistics helper added to `metrics.py` before writing to the executive sheet. | Structured mode with tote manifests, optionally mirrored in continuous mode when `--expected` injects an attempt list. | Ensures dock workers hit the read zone on every try, highlighting retraining needs. |
| **ToteCycleTimeSeconds** | Average time a tote spends in the read zone between first and last valid EPC read. | `mean(last_timestamp - first_timestamp)` per tote, using dwell slices from `continuous_mode.analyze_continuous_flow` (collapse EPCs by tote ID, filter to header `331A`). | Continuous mode or hybrid sessions with tote timing enabled. | Measures dock throughput by revealing how quickly totes traverse the read portal. |
| **MissedLogisticsEPCs** | Count of expected tote EPCs (header `331A`) that never produced a read during the attempt window. | `expected_331A_set - observed_331A_set`; `expected` originates from layout or manifest loaders in `parser.py`, `observed` comes from the per-EPC summary prepared by `metrics.summarize_by_epc`. Attempt windows follow the attempt-bucket start/end boundaries computed for AttemptSuccessRate. | Structured mode with manifests; continuous mode when manifest injected via CLI. | Flags physical placement or hardware gaps that stop serialized totes from being captured. |
| **DuplicateLogisticsReads** | Average redundant reads per logistics EPC within a single attempt. | `total_reads_for_331A / unique_331A_reads` computed inside the same logistics helper as AttemptSuccessRate, ensuring duplicate exclusion outside the attempt window. | All modes when 331A filtering is active. | Indicates RF tuning issues when redundancy is excessive or too low for validation. |
| **SpatialCoverageLogistics** | Share of dock spatial zones that observed at least one logistics EPC during the session. | `covered_zones / total_zones`, where zones derive from layout coordinates (`Face`, `Row`, `Column`) or a synthetic grid; calculated by extending `metrics.calculate_layout_face_coverage` to expose 331A coverage masks plus RSSI minimum thresholds. | Structured mode with positional metadata; hybrid sessions with virtual grids. | Confirms that antennas cover every physical side of the pallet or tote staging area. |
| **ConcurrentToteCapacity** | Maximum number of logistics totes present simultaneously in the read zone. | `max(active_totes_per_second)` calculated from the `concurrency_timeline` produced by `continuous_mode.analyze_continuous_flow`, after mapping EPCs to tote IDs and aggregating counts. | Continuous mode and hybrid sessions with concurrency export enabled. | Reveals whether the dock can handle peak wave arrivals without reader saturation. |
| **ReaderUptimeFromMetadata** | Portion of the session where the reader reported uptime telemetry, indicating no outages. | `reported_uptime_seconds / scheduled_session_seconds`, pulling uptime from ItemTest metadata columns parsed alongside CSV ingestion (extend `parser.py` metadata extraction to capture `ReaderUptime` and `SessionDuration`). | Both modes when metadata is available. | Assures operations that the read zone stayed online during the shift. |

> **Implementation alignment:** Extend `metrics.py` with logistics-specific helpers (e.g., `summarize_logistics_attempts`) that reuse `summarize_by_epc` output, implement attempt bucketing, and surface zone coverage masks. `continuous_mode.analyze_continuous_flow` already emits the `concurrency_timeline`; ensure tote-level collapsing occurs before the executive report is built. Metadata fields captured in `parser.py` must be forwarded through `itemtest_analyzer.py` into the KPI dictionary so the executive sheet assembled in `report.py` reflects the same values used for analytics.

### üßæ Resultado Field Guidance

* **Definition:** The "Resultado" column in the `Indicadores_Executivos` worksheet captures the numeric outcome delivered to leadership for each KPI.
* **Units & Formats:**
  * Percentages (`CoverageRate`, `AttemptSuccessRate`, `ReaderUptimeFromMetadata`) are rendered as `%` with two decimal places.
  * Time-based KPIs (`ToteCycleTimeSeconds`, `TagDwellTimeAvg`, `SessionDuration`) are shown in seconds; when exceeding 300 seconds, the executive writer in `report.py` should apply a `mm:ss` formatter (extend the `_append_executive` pipeline with a helper to convert long durations).
  * Counts (`MissedLogisticsEPCs`, `ConcurrentToteCapacity`, `TotalDistinctEPCs`) remain as integers.
  * Rates (`ThroughputPerMinute`, `DuplicateLogisticsReads`) retain one decimal place via the formatter call passed to `_append_executive`.
* **Aggregation windows:**
  * Structured metrics aggregate across the full manifest (single batch) unless multiple attempts are detected, in which case the logistics helper feeding `metrics.compile_structured_kpis` must emit both attempt-level rows and a session-average that the executive sheet records as the main "Resultado".
  * Continuous metrics aggregate over the reader session duration as reported by `continuous_mode.analyze_continuous_flow`; concurrency-related KPIs also store the timestamp of the peak in auxiliary columns while keeping the numeric peak in "Resultado".
  * Hybrid sessions compute attempt-level metrics using the tote window boundaries derived from manifest timestamps aligned with the dwell intervals returned by `analyze_continuous_flow`; the session summary "Resultado" is the weighted average by attempt duration.
* **Executive interpretation examples:**
  * `Coverage (%) = 98.7` ‚Üí "Pallet validation achieved near-perfect capture; no re-run required."
  * `ToteCycleTimeSeconds = 42.5` ‚Üí "Average tote spent 42.5 s in the portal‚Äîdock flow is within the 45 s SLA."
  * `ReaderUptimeFromMetadata = 88.0%` ‚Üí "Reader uptime fell below the 95% target; schedule maintenance."
  * `DuplicateLogisticsReads = 3.1` ‚Üí "Three reads per tote suggest the antennas are stable‚Äîno retuning needed."

**Implementation links:** The executive table is assembled in `report.py` through the `_append_executive` helper; feed it with the KPI dictionary built in `itemtest_analyzer.py` from `metrics.compile_structured_kpis`, the continuous analysis payload returned by `continuous_mode.analyze_continuous_flow`, and the logistics helpers described above. Capture `unit` and `aggregation_window` metadata alongside each KPI so future renderers (Excel, Power BI) can format "Resultado" consistently.

## üß∞ 7. Implementation Notes for Developers

* All metrics should be implemented as **pure functions** within `metrics.py`.
  Each function must accept a `pandas.DataFrame` and return a scalar or Series.
* Calculations must be **vectorized** for performance.
* Metrics must be **mode-aware** ‚Äî only relevant metrics should appear in each mode‚Äôs report.
* Aggregated executive KPIs (for Power BI or Streamlit) must be generated in `report.py`.
* Use descriptive names and maintain **unit consistency** (RSSI in dBm, time in seconds, rate in %).
* Each metric should include docstrings:

  ```python
  def calculate_coverage_rate(df: pd.DataFrame, expected_epcs: list[str]) -> float:
      """
      Calculates tag coverage percentage for structured tests.
      Args:
          df: DataFrame with EPC readings
          expected_epcs: list of expected EPC identifiers
      Returns:
          float: percentage of expected EPCs read
      """
  ```

---

## üß± 8. Example Calculation Flow (Continuous Mode)

1. Load CSV ‚Üí clean ‚Üí convert timestamps.
2. Group by EPC ‚Üí aggregate per time window (2s default).
3. Compute dwell times ‚Üí detect entry/exit events.
4. Aggregate global KPIs: throughput, dwell mean, concurrency.
5. Generate executive and technical sheets:

   * `Fluxo_Cont√≠nuo`
   * `Indicadores_Executivos`
   * `Resumo_por_EPC`

## üß† 10. Executive Summary Generation Template

The report module should produce a concise summary like:

> **Session Summary ‚Äî Dock Test (2025-10-20)**
> Reader: `192.168.68.100` (ModeIndex 1002, DualTarget)
> EPCs detected: **1,280**
> Avg RSSI: **‚Äì53.2 dBm**
> Avg Dwell: **3.4 s**
> Coverage: **98.1%** (structured mode)
> Peak concurrency: **87 EPCs**
> Antenna #3 contributed **47%** of total reads.
> No anomalies detected in RSSI or frequency distribution.

---

## üìò 11. Maintenance Recommendations

* Maintain separation of **data ingestion**, **metric computation**, and **report generation** layers.
* For versioning, add metric version tags (`v1.0`, `v1.1`) as column suffixes when formulas evolve.
* Validate against at least one **reference test CSV** per mode before merging new logic.
* Keep historical KPI definitions archived for auditability.
